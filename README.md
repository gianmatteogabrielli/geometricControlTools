# Controlled Invariant Subspaces

This repository contains a collection of functions for the computation of **controlled invariant subspaces** in linear systems theory.  
The implementations follow the operators and methods presented in Giovanni Marroâ€™s book on geometric control theory.

## Features
- Computation of controlled invariant subspaces.  
- Implementation of fundamental operators for subspace analysis.  
- Utility functions, such as the computation of the **inverse image of a subspace**.  
- Modular and extensible structure for future developments.  

## Applications
These functions are useful for:
- Geometric control theory studies.  
- Regulation and disturbance decoupling problems in linear systems.  
- Analysis of structural properties of dynamical systems.
